# Hash table in Python
# Dict implements hash table. Hash table is the underlying data structure in dict.
# What is hash function?
    # see the image but there are many more different ways to implement hash function
    # lookup by key is O(1) on average
    # insertion and deletion is O(1) on average
    # in worst case, it might be more than O(1)

# python - dictionary
# java - hashmap, linkedhashmap
# c++ - std::map
